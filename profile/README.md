# Discendo Discimus

This organization is a collection of projects that I have worked on, or am working on, in my spare time. I am a full-time software engineer, and these projects are my way of learning new technologies, and having fun. I am a big fan of open source, and I try to contribute to as many projects as I can. I am also a big fan of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), and I try to follow it as much as possible.
